# Chat App Weekend Assignment
Chat application that begins with the server asking the client for their name, then the conversation continuing thereafter.

The application is run by startng the ChatAppRunner, then starting the ChatAppClient.

After beginning the application, the server asks the client for a name, then a standard chat can continue.

The connection is run on a thread so that the conversation is never caught up in a blocking call.
